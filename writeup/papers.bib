For such materials, quantum effects define their physical behaviour and open completely new (quantum) perspectives for applications. Carbon-based materials are particularly good examples, highlighted by the fascinating quantum properties of, for example, nanotubes or graphene. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis and application of ultrapure isotopically controlled single-crystal chemical vapour deposition (CVD) diamond with a remarkably low concentration of paramagnetic impurities. The content of nuclear spins associated with the (13)C isotope was depleted to 0.3{\%} and the concentration of other paramagnetic defects was measured to be {\textless}10(13) cm(-3). Being placed in such a spin-free lattice, single electron spins show the longest room-temperature spin dephasing times ever observed in solid-state systems (T2=1.8 ms). This benchmark will potentially allow observation of coherent coupling between spins separated by a few tens of nanometres, making it a versatile material for room-temperature quantum information processing devices. We also show that single electron spins in the same isotopically engineered CVD diamond can be used to detect external magnetic fields with a sensitivity reaching 4 nT Hz(-1/2) and subnanometre spatial resolution.},

Here we demonstrate an improvement of more than two orders of magnitude in the spin coherence time (T₂) of nitrogen-vacancy centres compared with previous measurements: T₂≈0.6 s at 77 K. We employed dynamical decoupling pulse sequences to suppress nitrogen-vacancy spin decoherence, and found that T₂ is limited to approximately half of the longitudinal spin relaxation time over a wide range of temperatures, which we attribute to phonon-induced decoherence. Our results apply to ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy spins, and thus could advance quantum sensing, enable squeezing and many-body entanglement, and open a path to simulating driven, interaction-dominated quantum many-body Hamiltonians.},

abstract = {Spontaneous emission of radiation is one of the fundamental mechanisms by which an excited quantum system returns to equilibrium. For spins, however, spontaneous emission is generally negligible compared to other non-radiative relaxation processes because of the weak coupling between the magnetic dipole and the electromagnetic field. In 1946, Purcell realized 1 that the rate of spontaneous emission can be greatly enhanced by placing the quantum system in a resonant cavity. This effect has since been used extensively to control the lifetime of atoms and semiconducting heterostructures coupled to microwave 2 or optical 3,4 cavities, and is essential for the realization of high-efficiency single-photon sources 5 . Here we report the application of this idea to spins in solids. By coupling donor spins in silicon to a superconducting microwave cavity with a high quality factor and a small mode volume, we reach the regime in which spontaneous emission constitutes the dominant mechanism of spin relaxation. The relaxation rate is increased by three orders of magnitude as the spins are tuned to the cavity resonance, demonstrating that energy relaxation can be controlled on demand. Our results provide a general way to initialize spin systems into their ground state and therefore have applications in magnetic resonance and quantum information processing 6 . They also demonstrate that the coupling between the magnetic dipole of a spin and the electromagnetic field can be enhanced up to the point at which quantum fluctuations have a marked effect on the spin dynamics; as such, they represent an important step towards the coherent magnetic coupling of individual spins to microwave photons. Spin relaxation is the process by which a spin reaches thermal equi-librium by exchanging an energy quantum ħ$\omega$ s with its environment (where ħ is the reduced Planck constant and $\omega$ s is the resonance fre-quency of the spin), for example in the form of a photon or a phonon, as shown in Fig. 1a. Understanding and controlling spin relaxation is essential in applications such as spintronics 7},

The design of the proposed MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical system) stage is based on a parallel kinematics mechanism (PKM). The stage is fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate. The PKM design decouples the motion in the XY directions. The design restricts rotations in the XY plane while allowing for an increased motion range and produces linear kinematics in the operating region (or workspace) of the stage. The truss-like structure of the PKM also results in increased stiffness by reducing the mass of the stage. The stage is fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer using surface micromachining and a deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) process. Two sets of electrostatic linear comb drives are used to actuate the stage mechanism in the X and Y directions. The fabricated stage provides a motion range of more than 15 um in each direction at a driving voltage of 45 V. The resonant frequency of the stage under ambient conditions is 960 Hz.

Pushing sensing capabilities to the individual-spin level would enable unprecedented applications such as single molecule structural imaging; however, the weak magnetic fields from single spins are undetectable by conventional far-field resonance techniques. In recent years, there has been a considerable effort to develop nanoscale scanning magnetometers, which are able to measure fewer spins by bringing the sensor in close proximity to its target. The most sensitive of these magnetometers generally require low temperatures for operation, but measuring under ambient conditions (standard temperature and pressure) is critical for many imaging applications, particularly in biological systems. Here we demonstrate detection and nanoscale imaging of the magnetic field from a single electron spin under ambient conditions using a scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometer. Real-space, quantitative magnetic-field images are obtained by deterministically scanning our NV magnetometer 50 nanometers above a target electron spin, while measuring the local magnetic field using dynamically decoupled magnetometry protocols. This single-spin detection capability could enable single-spin magnetic resonance imaging of electron spins on the nano- and atomic scales and opens the door for unique applications such as mechanical quantum state transfer.},

These results demonstrate that we can replace three terminal transistors by a single terminal dispersive reservoir, promising for high bandwidth scalable donor control and readout.},

abstract = {Electronic spins in semiconductors have been used extensively to explore the limits of external control over quantum mechanical phenomena. A long-standing goal of this research has been to identify or develop robust quantum systems that can be easily manipulated, for future use in advanced information and communication technologies. Recently, a point defect in diamond known as the nitrogen-vacancy centre has attracted a great deal of interest because it possesses an atomic-scale electronic spin state that can be used as an individually addressable, solid-state quantum bit (qubit), even at room temperature. These exceptional quantum properties have motivated efforts to identify similar defects in other semiconductors, as they may offer an expanded range of functionality not available to the diamond nitrogen-vacancy centre. Notably, several defects in silicon carbide (SiC) have been suggested as good candidates for exploration, owing to a combination of computational predictions and magnetic resonance data. Here we demonstrate that several defect spin states in the 4H polytype of SiC (4H-SiC) can be optically addressed and coherently controlled in the time domain at temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 kelvin. Using optical and microwave techniques similar to those used with diamond nitrogen-vacancy qubits, we study the spin-1 ground state of each of four inequivalent forms of the neutral carbon-silicon divacancy, as well as a pair of defect spin states of unidentified origin. These defects are optically active near telecommunication wavelengths, and are found in a host material for which there already exist industrial-scale crystal growth and advanced microfabrication techniques. In addition, they possess desirable spin coherence properties that are comparable to those of the diamond nitrogen-vacancy centre. This makes them promising candidates for various photonic, spintronic and quantum information applications that merge quantum degrees of freedom with classical electronic and optical technologies.},

For electron spins bound to shallow donors in silicon, bulk electrically-detected magnetic resonance has relied on coupling to spin readout partners such as paramagnetic defects or conduction electrons which fundamentally limits spin coherence times. Here we demonstrate electrical detection of phosphorus donor electron spin resonance by transport through a silicon device, using optically-driven donor-bound exciton transitions. We use this method to measure electron spin Rabi oscillations, and, by avoiding use of an ancillary spin for readout, we are able to obtain long intrinsic electron spin coherence times, limited only by the donor concentration. We go on to experimentally address critical issues for adopting this scheme for single spin measurement in silicon nanodevices, including the effects of strain, electric fields, and non-resonant excitation. This lays the foundations for realising a versatile readout method for single spin readout with relaxed magnetic field and temperature requirements compared with spin-dependent tunneling.},

abstract = {Whether a quantum bath can be approximated as classical noise is a fundamental issue in central spin decoherence and also of practical importance in designing noise-resilient quantum control. Spin qubits based on bismuth donors in silicon have tunable interactions with nuclear spin baths and are first-order insensitive to magnetic noise at so-called clock-transitions (CTs). This system is therefore ideal for studying the quantum/classical nature of nuclear spin baths since the qubit-bath interaction strength determines the back-action on the baths and hence the adequacy of a classical noise model. We develop a Gaussian noise model with noise correlations determined by quantum calculations and compare the classical noise approximation to the full quantum bath theory. We experimentally test our model through dynamical decoupling sequence of up to 128 pulses, finding good agreement with simulations and measuring electron spin coherence times approaching one second - notably using natural silicon. Our theoretical and experimental study demonstrates that the noise from a nuclear spin bath is analogous to classical Gaussian noise if the back-action of the qubit on the bath is small compared to the internal bath dynamics, as is the case close to CTs. However, far from the CTs, the back-action of the central spin on the bath is such that the quantum model is required to accurately model spin decoherence.},

At a glance Figures First | 1-2 of 2 | Last View all figures left Two-dimensional representation of the atomic structure of silicon carbide, showing divacancy lattice defects. Figure 1 Three-dimensional representation of the silicon carbide lattice. Figure 2 right Until about 20 years ago, physics students were taught that one never observes a single quantum-mechanical system. Instead, experiments should always be conducted on large ensembles of identical particles. This point of view has been superseded by landmark experiments in which individual quantum systems were measured and controlled with exquisite precision. The first physical systems of choice were individual photons, atoms held in vacuum, or single Josephson superconducting devices1. While these exciting developments on single-particle systems were reshaping our understanding of quantum mechanics and gaining Nobel prizes2, 3, researchers aiming at applying this knowledge in practical applications such as secure communications and quantum computing were ramping up their interest in diamond and silicon. This was because it had been found that certain defects in these materials exhibit unique quantum-mechanical behaviour4, 5. Electrons trapped at these defects possess an intrinsic angular momentum, commonly referred to as spin, which can be prepared in an arbitrary quantum state, and preserved for long time periods, called the spin coherence time. The electron and nuclear spins associated with nitrogen–vacancy centres in diamond6, and phosphorus impurities in silicon7, are by far the most coherent quantum objects to have been individually observed and manipulated in the solid state. These two materials demonstrate complementary properties for possibly realizing new spintronic devices: diamond offers optically accessible quantum states and room-temperature operation, whereas silicon provides an unparalleled platform for nanofabrication and electrical interfacing. Silicon carbide, a compound of these two materials, could in principle combine the best of both worlds, allowing for a single optically addressable spin, with long coherence times even at room temperature, embedded in a high-performance electronic material. Writing in Nature Materials, two collaborations demonstrate single-spin control in silicon carbide with optically detected magnetic resonance measurements.},

Although this presents a significant challenge for the further scaling of microprocessors, it provides the potential for radical innovations in the form of spin-based quantum computers and spintronic devices. An electron spin in silicon can represent a well-isolated quantum bit with long coherence times because of the weak spin-orbit coupling and the possibility of eliminating nuclear spins from the bulk crystal. However, the control of single electrons in silicon has proved challenging, and so far the observation and manipulation of a single spin has been impossible. Here we report the demonstration of single-shot, time-resolved readout of an electron spin in silicon. This has been performed in a device consisting of implanted phosphorus donors coupled to a metal-oxide-semiconductor single-electron transistor-compatible with current microelectronic technology. We observed a spin lifetime of ∼6 seconds at a magnetic field of 1.5 tesla, and achieved a spin readout fidelity better than 90 per cent. High-fidelity single-shot spin readout in silicon opens the way to the development of a new generation of quantum computing and spintronic devices, built using the most important material in the semiconductor industry.},

Phosphorus dopants in silicon (Si:P) have been favoured as hosts for such spins because of measured electron spin coherence times (T2) longer than any other electron spin in the solid state: 14 ms at 7 K. Heavier impurities such as bismuth in silicon (Si:Bi) could be used in conjunction with Si:P for quantum information proposals that require two separately addressable spin species. However, the question of whether the incorporation of the much less soluble Bi into Si leads to defect species that destroy coherence has not been addressed. Here we show that schemes involving Si:Bi are indeed feasible as the electron spin coherence time T2 exceeds 1 ms at 10 K. We polarized the Si:Bi electrons and hyperpolarized the I=9/2 nuclear spin of 209Bi, manipulating both with pulsed magnetic resonance. The larger nuclear spin means that a Si:Bi dopant provides a 20-dimensional Hilbert space rather than the four dimensional Hilbert space of an I=1/2 Si:P dopant.},

The state is left in the nuclear spin on a time- scale that is long compared with the electron decoherence time, and is then coherently transferred back to the electron spin, thus demonstrating the 31P nuclear spin as a solid-state quantum memory.

abstract = {The spin of an electron or a nucleus in a semiconductor [1] naturally implements the unit of quantum information -- the qubit -- while providing a technological link to the established electronics industry [2]. The solid-state environment, however, may provide deleterious interactions between the qubit and the nuclear spins of surrounding atoms [3], or charge and spin fluctuators in defects, oxides and interfaces [4]. For group IV materials such as silicon, enrichment of the spin-zero 28-Si isotope drastically reduces spin-bath decoherence [5]. Experiments on bulk spin ensembles in 28-Si crystals have indeed demonstrated extraordinary coherence times [6-8]. However, it remained unclear whether these would persist at the single-spin level, in gated nanostructures near amorphous interfaces. Here we present the coherent operation of individual 31-P electron and nuclear spin qubits in a top-gated nanostructure, fabricated on an isotopically engineered 28-Si substrate. We report new benchmarks for coherence time ({\textgreater} 30 seconds) and control fidelity ({\textgreater} 99.99{\%}) of any single qubit in solid state, and perform a detailed noise spectroscopy [9] to demonstrate that -- contrary to widespread belief -- the coherence is not limited by the proximity to an interface. Our results represent a fundamental advance in control and understanding of spin qubits in nanostructures.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design, kinematic and dynamic analysis, fabrication and characterization of a monolithic micro/nanopositioning three degrees-of-freedom (DOF) (XY$\theta$) stage. The design of the proposed MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical system) stage is based on a parallel-kinematic mechanism (PKM) scheme that allows for translation in the XY plane and rotation about the Z axis, an increased motion range, and linear kinematics in the operating region (or work area) of the stage. The truss-like structure of the PKM results in higher modal frequencies by increasing the structural stiffness and reducing the moving mass of the stage. The stage is fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer using surface micromachining and deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) processes. Three sets of electrostatic linear comb drives jointly actuate the mechanism to produce motion in the X, Y and $\theta$ (rotation) directions. The fabricated stage provides a motion range of 18 $\mu$m and 1.72° at a driving voltage of 85 V. The resonant frequency of the stage under ambient conditions is 465 Hz. Additionally a high Q factor (∼66) is achieved from this parallel-kinematics mechanism design. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we study 209Bi implanted Si concerning the correlation between the strain produced by stopped Bi ions and trapping characteristics of the defects resulted from implantation. The depths distributions of stopped ions and primary defects are simulated and the distributions of permanent defects are modelled for Si implanted with low fluence 209Bi ions of 28 MeV kinetic energy. For comparison, these depths distributions were similarly calculated for 127I ions with the same fluence and energy, implanted in Si. The results are compared with each other and correlated with the characteristics of traps in these systems, previously obtained. We demonstrate that the intensity of the strain field is the most important factor in changing of trap parameters, while the superposition between the region with strain and the region where defects are located is a second order effect.},

A multi-valley effective mass theory, dealing non-perturbatively with valley-orbit interactions induced by a donor-dependent central cell potential, allows us to obtain a very reliable picture of the donor wave function within a relatively simple framework. Variational optimization of the 1s donor binding energies calculated with a new trial wave function, in a pseudopotential with two fitting parameters, allows an accurate match of the experimentally determined donor energy levels, while the correct limiting behavior for the electronic density, both close to and far from each impurity nucleus, is captured by fitting the measured contact hyperfine coupling between the donor nuclear and electron spin.   We go on to include an external uniform electric field in order to model Stark physics: With no extra ad hoc parameters, variational minimization of the complete donor ground energy allows a quantitative description of the field-induced reduction of electronic density at each impurity nucleus. Detailed comparisons with experimental values for the shifts of the contact hyperfine coupling reveal very close agreement for all the donors measured (P, As, Sb and Bi). Finally, we estimate field ionization thresholds for the donor ground states, thus setting upper limits to the gate manipulation times for single qubit operations in Kane-like architectures: the Si:Bi system is shown to allow for A gates as fast as around 10 MHz.},

Atoms have been successfully used to store and process quantum information in electromagnetic traps, as well as in diamond through the use of the nitrogen-vacancy-centre point defect. Solid-state electrical devices possess great potential to scale up such demonstrations from few-qubit control to larger-scale quantum processors. Coherent control of spin qubits has been achieved in lithographically defined double quantum dots in both GaAs (refs 3-5) and Si (ref. 6). However, it is a formidable challenge to combine the electrical measurement capabilities of engineered nanostructures with the benefits inherent in atomic spin qubits. Here we demonstrate the coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin qubit bound to a phosphorus donor atom in natural silicon, measured electrically via single-shot read-out. We use electron spin resonance to drive Rabi oscillations, and a Hahn echo pulse sequence reveals a spin coherence time exceeding 200 µs. This time should be even longer in isotopically enriched (28)Si samples. Combined with a device architecture that is compatible with modern integrated circuit technology, the electron spin of a single phosphorus atom in silicon should be an excellent platform on which to build a scalable quantum computer.},

abstract = {Detection of nuclear spin precession is critical for a wide range of scientific techniques that have applications in diverse fields including analytical chemistry, materials science, medicine and biology. Fundamentally, it is possible because of the extreme isolation of nuclear spins from their environment. This isolation also makes single nuclear spins desirable for quantum-information processing, as shown by pioneering studies on nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. The nuclear spin of a (31)P donor in silicon is very promising as a quantum bit: bulk measurements indicate that it has excellent coherence times and silicon is the dominant material in the microelectronics industry. Here we demonstrate electrical detection and coherent manipulation of a single (31)P nuclear spin qubit with sufficiently high fidelities for fault-tolerant quantum computing. By integrating single-shot readout of the electron spin with on-chip electron spin resonance, we demonstrate quantum non-demolition and electrical single-shot readout of the nuclear spin with a readout fidelity higher than 99.8 percent-the highest so far reported for any solid-state qubit. The single nuclear spin is then operated as a qubit by applying coherent radio-frequency pulses. For an ionized (31)P donor, we find a nuclear spin coherence time of 60 milliseconds and a one-qubit gate control fidelity exceeding 98 percent. These results demonstrate that the dominant technology of modern electronics can be adapted to host a complete electrical measurement and control platform for nuclear-spin-based quantum-information processing.},

Single-shot read-out of the state of a multi-quantum-bit (multi-qubit) register would allow direct investigation of quantum correlations (entanglement), and would give access to further key resources such as quantum error correction and deterministic quantum teleportation. Although spins in solids are attractive candidates for scalable quantum information processing, their single-shot detection has been achieved only for isolated qubits. Here we demonstrate the preparation and measurement of a multi-spin quantum register in a low-temperature solid-state system by implementing resonant optical excitation techniques originally developed in atomic physics. We achieve high-fidelity read-out of the electronic spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond, and use this read-out to project up to three nearby nuclear spin qubits onto a well-defined state. Conversely, we can distinguish the state of the nuclear spins in a single shot by mapping it onto, and subsequently measuring, the electronic spin. Finally, we show compatibility with qubit control: we demonstrate initialization, coherent manipulation and single-shot read-out in a single experiment on a two-qubit register, using techniques suitable for extension to larger registers.

abstract = {Control of hyperfine interactions is a fundamental requirement for quantum computing architecture schemes based on shallow donors in silicon. However, at present, there is lacking an atomistic approach including critical effects of central-cell corrections and non-static screening of the donor potential capable of describing the hyperfine interaction in the presence of both strain and electric fields in realistically sized devices. We establish and apply a theoretical framework, based on atomistic tight-binding theory, to quantitatively determine the strain and electric field dependent hyperfine couplings of donors. Our method is scalable to millions of atoms, and yet captures the strain effects with an accuracy level of DFT method. Excellent agreement with the available experimental data sets allow reliable investigation of the design space of multi-qubit architectures, based on both strain-only as well as hybrid (strain+field) control of qubits. The benefits of strain are uncovered by demonstrating that a hybrid control of qubits based on (001) compressive strain and in-plane (100 or 010) fields results in higher gate fidelities and/or faster gate operations, for all of the four donor species considered (P, As, Sb, and Bi). The comparison between different donor species in strained environments further highlights the trends of hyperfine shifts, providing predictions where no experimental data exists. Whilst faster gate operations are realisable with in-plane fields for P, As, and Sb donors, only for the Bi donor, our calculations predict faster gate response in the presence of both in-plane and out-of-plane fields, truly benefiting from the proposed planar field control mechanism of the hyperfine interactions.},

abstract = {To expand the capabilities of semiconductor devices for new functions exploiting the quantum states of single donors or other impurity atoms requires a deterministic fabrication method. Ion implantation is a standard tool of the semiconductor industry and we have developed pathways to deterministic ion implantation to address this challenge. Although ion straggling limits the precision with which atoms can be positioned, for single atom devices it is possible to use post-implantation techniques to locate favourably placed atoms in devices for control and readout. However, large-scale devices will require improved precision. We examine here how the method of ion beam induced charge, already demonstrated for the deterministic ion implantation of 14{\^{A}} keV P donor atoms in silicon, can be used to implant a non-Poisson distribution of ions in silicon. Further, we demonstrate the method can be developed to higher precision by the incorporation of new deterministic ion implantation strategies that employ on-chip detectors with internal charge gain. In a silicon device we show a pulse height spectrum for 14{\^{A}} keV P ion impact that shows an internal gain of 3 that has the potential of allowing deterministic implantation of sub-14{\^{A}} keV P ions with reduced straggling.},

abstract = {Exciting progress towards spin-based quantum computing[1, 2] has recently been made with qubits realized using nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) centers in diamond and phosphorus atoms in silicon[3], including the demonstra- tion of long coherence times made possible by the presence of spin-free isotopes of carbon[4] and silicon[5]. However, despite promising single-atom nanotechnologies[6], there remain substantial challenges in coupling such qubits and addressing them individually. Conversely, lithographically defined quantum dots have an ex- change coupling that can be precisely engineered1, but strong coupling to noise has severely limited their de- phasing times and control fidelities. Here we combine the best aspects of both spin qubit schemes and demon- strate a gate-addressable quantum dot qubit in isotopically engineered silicon with a control fidelity of 99.6{\%}, obtained via Clifford based randomized benchmarking and consistent with that required for fault-tolerant quan- tum computing[7, 8]. This qubit has orders of magnitude improved coherence times compared with other quantum dot qubits, with T∗ 2 = 120 µs and T2 = 28 ms. By gate-voltage tuning of the electron g∗-factor, we can Stark shift the electron spin resonance (ESR) frequency by more than 3000 times the 2.4 kHz ESR linewidth, providing a direct path to large-scale arrays of addressable high-fidelity qubits that are compatible with existing manufacturing technologies.

abstract = {Error correction is important in classical and quantum computation. Decoherence caused by the inevitable interaction of quantum bits with their environment leads to dephasing or even relaxation. Correction of the concomitant errors is therefore a fundamental requirement for scalable quantum computation. Although algorithms for error correction have been known for some time, experimental realizations are scarce. Here we show quantum error correction in a heterogeneous, solid-state spin system. We demonstrate that joint initialization, projective readout and fast local and non-local gate operations can all be achieved in diamond spin systems, even under ambient conditions. High-fidelity initialization of a whole spin register (99 per cent) and single-shot readout of multiple individual nuclear spins are achieved by using the ancillary electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy defect. Implementation of a novel non-local gate generic to our electron-nuclear quantum register allows the preparation of entangled states of three nuclear spins, with fidelities exceeding 85 per cent. With these techniques, we demonstrate three-qubit phase-flip error correction. Using optimal control, all of the above operations achieve fidelities approaching those needed for fault-tolerant quantum operation, thus paving the way to large-scale quantum computation. Besides their use with diamond spin systems, our techniques can be used to improve scaling of quantum networks relying on phosphorus in silicon, quantum dots, silicon carbide or rare-earth ions in solids.},

This is particularly important in nanodevices where the proximity of material interfaces, and their associated defects, can play a limiting role. Spin decoherence can be addressed to varying degrees by improving material purity or isotopic composition, for example, or active error correction methods such as dynamic decoupling (or even combinations of the two). However, a powerful method applied to trapped ions in the context of atomic clocks is the use of particular spin transitions that are inherently robust to external perturbations. Here, we show that such 'clock transitions' can be observed for electron spins in the solid state, in particular using bismuth donors in silicon. This leads to dramatic enhancements in the electron spin coherence time, exceeding seconds. We find that electron spin qubits based on clock transitions become less sensitive to the local magnetic environment, including the presence of (29)Si nuclear spins as found in natural silicon. We expect the use of such clock transitions will be of additional significance for donor spins in nanodevices, mitigating the effects of magnetic or electric field noise arising from nearby interfaces and gates.},
