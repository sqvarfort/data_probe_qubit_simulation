\subsection{Spin species}

Having demonstrated how the parity measurement is realised and how long each measurement could take we can now look into different available spin systems. 

As shown in the previous sections we require $\Delta d^3/ J > 10^4$. This is achieved by choosing two different spin species for the data and probe qubits. Any sensible combination of species given in Table. \ref*{TAB:qubits} fulfils this criterion.

For the data qubits we desire qubits with long coherence to maintain the quantum information throughout a large number of parity measurements. Furthermore, we only require global control for the data qubits during operation as logical operations on the encoded qubits can be performed using the stabilizer measurements.
In case of the probe qubits we require coherence times which are longer than the time it takes to perform a parity measurement. In addition to that readout is very important and individual control is required.

TALK ABOUT T2* AND T2

Donors in silicon are excellent candidates for both data and probe qubits as they offer extremely long coherence times when implanted in purified $^{28}$Si (see Table. \ref{TAB:qubits}). Moreover, electrical read out of high-fidelity using a single-eletron-transistor (SET) \cite{Pla2012,Pla2013,Muhonen2014} as well as optical \cite{Lo2015} read out has been demonstrated for $^{31}$P donors and is feasible for $^{209}$Bi. Control of individual spins can be achieved by tuning them in and out of resonance using the stark effect \cite{Pica2014}. The control electronics has a small footprint making a large scale implementation feasible. Being able to transfer the electron spin state to the nuclear spin offers even longer coherence times. Finally, $^{209}$Bi has several clock transitions (CT) which are insensitive to magnetic fields leading to very long electron spin coherence times ($T_2=2.7\, $s). However, operation in this regime will make the $^{209}$Bi qubit also insensitive to the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction. Tuning in an out of the CT will be necessary to implement the parity measurement. Proof-of-concept implementations could benefit from that fact that donors in silicon even offer moderate coherence times at elevated temperatures.

MEMS?


Besides donors in Si we imagine nitrogen vacancies (NV) to be a promising candidate for proof-of-concept demonstrations. NV centres are highly developed qubits \cite{Bar-Gill2013} which offer good coherence times even at room temperature (RT) \cite{Balasubramanian2009}. Individual addressing can be achieved using the stark effect. Optical read out and the possibility of integrating NV centres into an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip makes NV centres good candidates for a probe qubit \cite{Grinolds2013}. The optical read out of NV centres has one drawback as the readout frequency excites carriers in silicon. As a result of this read out has to be performed carefully in safe distance to the data qubits.

MEMS?

Recently, defects in SiC have attracted lots of attention \cite{Morello2015} as coherent manipulation of individual spins with predicted coherence times on the order of milliseconds has been demonstrated \cite{Widmann2014}. At cryogenic temperatures ($20\, $K) this has already been achieved \cite{Christle2014}. Current experiments still suffered from low collection efficiency. Having near infra-red transitions, SiC shows excellent prospects for integration with optical fibres. Moreover, AFM tip integration is feasible. However, SiC is still at a very early research stage.
