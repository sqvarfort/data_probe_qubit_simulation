\subsubsection{Twirling}

It is not the fact that the success probabilities are lower for odd parities than for even parity that is especially concerning; this is what fault-tolerant codes are designed to cope with. Instead it is the fact that bit-flips on each qubit give a \emph{different} probability of successful detection. This means one qubit will me more prone to undetected errors than others. The fault tolerance required by the proposal assumes a symmetry between the data qubits that this breaks, making the code susceptible to logical errors.

A method proposed to account for this is suggested in the proposal \cite{OGorman2016}. Their \emph{`twirling'} technique smooths out this asymmetry between data qubits by effectively switching the location of bit-flips randomly so that the phase accumulated due to any one bit-flip is on average the same as for any other bit-flip. This is done by randomly applying one of four unitary operations $\mathrm{U_1 = \op{I}\op{I}\op{I}\op{I}}$, $\mathrm{U_2 = \op{I}\op{I}\op{X}\op{X}}$, $\mathrm{U_3 = \op{I}\op{X}\op{I}\op{X}}$, $\mathrm{U_4 = \op{I}\op{X}\op{X}\op{I}}$, as illustrated in fig. \ref{fig:twirls}, both before and after the parity measurement.

This has the effect of making the average projection onto the $x$-axis the same for all odd parity cases as desired, at the expense of reduced success probability for even parity. This risks introducing Pauli errors \cite{OGorman2016} but provided the success probability is sufficiently high this is correctable by the code.
