\subsubsection{Twirling}

It is not the fact that the resultant success probabilities are lower than the even parity case that is especially concerning; this is what fault-tolerant codes are designed to cope with. Instead it is the fact that bit-flips on each qubit give a \emph{different} probability of successful detection. This means one qubit will me more prone to undetected errors than others. The fault tolerance required by the proposal assumes a symmetry between the data qubits that this breaks, making the code susceptible to logical errors.
