\section{Introduction}
We have simulated a probe qubit interacting with four data qubits. 


\section{Dephasing}
In this section, we present results from simulations of the Lindblad master equation where a dephasing channel is turned on. This channel contains the Lindblad operator
\beq
L  = 
\eeq

We evolve the system under the Lindblad master equation for an odd number of errors. This causes the final phase of the probe qubit to end up at $\phi = \pi$.
