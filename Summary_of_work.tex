\section{Introduction}
We have simulated a probe qubit interacting with four data qubits. The probe qubit is performing a circular orbit $40$ nm above the data qubits, and in this document we will document the effect of various errors. These errors include dephasing, dopan placement uncertainties and a path jitter. 


\section{Dephasing}
In this section, we present results from simulations of the Lindblad master equation where a dephasing channel is turned on. This channel contains the Lindblad operator
\beq
L  = \sqrt{\Gamma} \sigma_z
\eeq

where $\Gamma$ is the dephasing parameter. $\Gamma$ can also be written as $1/\tau$ where $\tau$ is the dephasing time. 

We evolve the system under the Lindblad master equation for an odd number of errors. This causes the final phase of the probe qubit to end up at $\phi = \pi$. 

In Figure \ref{fig:BlochsphereDephasing}, we see the effect of a small dephasing coefficient (100) whereas in Figure \ref{fig:somethig} we see the effect of larger dephasing (500). Note that the dephasing happens primarily as the interaction between the probe qubit and the data qubit is weak.

      \caption{The states of the probe and data qubits plotted in the Bloch sphere with zero dephasing. The data qubits remain in the $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ state respectively and the probe qubit precesses in a trajectory along the equator of the Bloch sphere, starting from the $\ket{+}$ state. The probe qubit speeds up at the beginning or end of each quadrant because it is then furthest away from the data qubits. In the last quadrant, the probe qubit reverses its direction and backtracks because the final data qubit in $\ket{1}$ contains an $X$ error.}

      \caption{The states of the probe and data qubits plotted in the Bloch sphere with a dephasing parameter of 100, which translates to a dephasing time of 10 ms. The phase of the probe qubit is not affected since no relaxation or excitation is taking place. The effect can however be seen in the probability of measuring the probe qubit in the $\ket{+}$ or $\ket{-}$ state. For complete dephasing, the probe qubit will become the maximally mixed state and the measurement outcomes are completely random. }
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:plot} we see the effect of dephasing on the probability of measuring the correct value of the probe qubit. Since there is an odd number of errors, we want the probe qubit to end up in the $\ket{-}$ state. However, the dephasing will cause the probe qubit to become a mixed state $\rho$, for which we have a finite probability of measuring $\ket{+} $ instead of $\ket{-}$. For complete dephasing, the probe qubit becomes a mixed state which has a 50-50\% chance of measuring either state. 

In Figure \ref{fig:Plot}, we have market the data-point for dephasing corresponding to the decoherence time for Bismuth, which is one of the proposed donor types for the probe qubit. The decoherence time of bismuth is 2.7 s \cite{something}, which leads to a dephasing parameter of 0.37 s$^{-1}$.

In this simulation, one of the data qubits have undergone a bit-flip error. As the dephasing parameter increases, the probe qubit moves towards the maximally mixed state and the probability of measuring $\ket{-}$ goes towards 0.5. The dephasing parameter for Bismuth as a material for the probe qubit has been market in the graph. }
